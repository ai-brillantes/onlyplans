# OnlyPlans — Marketing & Social Media Ideas

---

## Video Concept #1: "I Know We Don't Talk Every Day..."

**Format:** Talking head → emotional hook → product reveal
**Vibe:** Starts serious/vulnerable, lands warm and inviting. The kind of thing that stops a scroll.

### Script Variations

**A — The Drift**
> "I know we don't talk every day...
> and honestly, we probably won't start.
> But that doesn't mean we can't hang out.
> [pause]
> You just need a better excuse to reach out."
> *OnlyPlans — make it out of the group chat.*

**B — The Text Anxiety**
> "I know we're not on a texting basis...
> and that's fine. Not everyone needs to be.
> But if I told you where I'd be Friday night...
> would you show up?"
> *OnlyPlans — plans hit different than texts.*

**C — The Honest One**
> "We haven't hung out in months.
> Not because anything happened...
> we just stopped making plans.
> That's literally the only reason."
> *OnlyPlans — the app that makes you make plans.*

**D — The Group Chat Call-Out**
> "Your group chat has 47 unread messages.
> Zero of them are actual plans.
> [beat]
> What if one of them was?"
> *OnlyPlans — make it out of the group chat.*

**E — The Realization**
> "I know we don't talk every day...
> but I'd still show up if you invited me.
> Most people would.
> They're just waiting for someone to ask."
> *OnlyPlans — stop waiting. Start inviting.*

### Production Notes
- **Tone:** Genuine, not salesy. This should feel like a friend talking, not an ad.
- **Delivery:** Straight to camera, natural lighting, casual setting (couch, car, walking)
- **Music:** Lo-fi or soft ambient underneath, cuts out on the punchline
- **Length:** 15-30s (TikTok/Reels optimized)
- **CTA:** App name + tagline at the end, no "download now" energy
- **Target audience:** 20-somethings who have friends but don't see them enough

### Why This Works
The insight is universal — most friendships don't fade because of drama, they fade because nobody made a plan. That's literally OnlyPlans' whole thesis. This format validates the feeling ("it's not just you") and positions the app as the fix without being pushy.

## Seedance 2.0 — AI-Generated Sitcom & Viral Videos

### Concept
Use **Seedance 2.0** (via Kie.ai) to generate short-form AI video content for Dinder and other OnlyPlans features. Think sitcom-style skits and viral format clips — fully AI-generated, no filming needed.

### Dinder Content Ideas
- **"The Indecisive Couple"** — AI sitcom clip of two people going back and forth on where to eat, increasingly absurd suggestions, then Dinder solves it in one swipe
- **"Dinder Date Night"** — Sitcom cold open: couple on couch, both hungry, both stubborn. Dinder montage. Resolution. Laugh track optional.
- **"Speed Dinder"** — Rapid-fire swipe montage set to upbeat music, each rejected restaurant gets a dramatic reaction shot
- **"The Group Chat Meltdown"** — 4-way split screen of friends all vetoing each other's picks. Dinder consensus mode saves the day.

### Other OnlyPlans Viral Formats
- **"POV: Your friend actually follows through"** — AI-generated reaction/celebration clip when someone RSVPs yes
- **"The Flake"** — Sitcom bit about the friend who always cancels, OnlyPlans accountability features as the punchline

### Why Seedance 2.0
- High enough quality for social media posts (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)
- Can iterate fast — generate 10 variations, pick the best
- No actors, no scheduling, no editing software needed
- Cost-effective via Kie.ai credits

### Next Steps
- [ ] Wait for Seedance 2.0 availability on Kie.ai
- [ ] Test with Dinder "indecisive couple" concept first
- [ ] Evaluate quality — is it good enough for brand content or just meme-tier?
- [ ] If quality is there, build a content calendar of weekly AI-generated clips

## Future Concepts (Parking Lot)

- **"The Plan That Almost Happened"** — Montage of group chat screenshots where plans die ("who's down?" → silence → "nvm"). OnlyPlans swoops in.
- **"Dinder Decision"** — Two friends staring at each other "where do you wanna eat?" for way too long. Cut to Dinder swipe UI solving it instantly.
- **"The Vibe Check"** — Someone scrolling through contacts wondering who's free tonight. Vibe Check feature shows availability without the awkward "wyd" text.
